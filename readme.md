### FooocusPlus – AI Art Made Simple

FooocusPlus is a community-developed AI image generation application that makes creating stunning works of art easier than ever. FooocusPlus runs offline on your computer and is completely free! Now you can have your very own Stable Diffusion or Midjourney that helps turn your creative ideas into beautiful images without any technical skills.

**Features**

- Generate stunning images with meticulously prepared presets – just describe your new masterpiece and watch it come to life
- Get inspiration for your art – choose from an extensive list of styles, or use our integrated AI assistant to help you write the perfect prompt
- Enhance existing images using AI – banish Photoshop editing with advanced image modification tools, or even use an existing picture as inspiration for a new creation!
- Bring the power of community home – use LoRA models from websites like Civitai to add new concepts to your images
- Full control at your fingertips – simple one-click access to advanced generation options, letting you use custom settings like a pro without ever leaving our friendly user interface
- Multilingual – full support for English, French, and Chinese out of the box
- Private – runs on your computer and does not send information about your identity or AI art generation to third parties without your consent

**Supported Models**

FooocusPlus gives you access to all of the latest AI image generation models, including:

- Stable Diffusion XL
- Pony Diffusion XL
- Flux
- Kwai Kolors
- Playground 2.5
- Hunyuan-DiT
- Stable Diffusion 3.5 (temporarily disabled)

If you’re new to AI art, don’t worry! Our simple preset selectors, located either in a bar at the top of the FooocusPlus window or as a dropdown menu to the right of the main canvas (your choice), will give you one-click access to all of these exciting AI image generation models without any prior knowledge required. You'll be able to choose your own favorite model in no time.

**System Requirements**

To run FooocusPlus, you will need a computer with a graphics card capable of running advanced AI software, including at least:

- 6GB of video RAM (8GB recommended for SDXL, 12GB for Flux)
- 16GB of system RAM (32GB recommended for SDXL, 48GB for Flux)
- 50GB of hard drive space

While some graphics cards with 4GB of video RAM (VRAM) will work - some of them even supporting Flux - image generation may be slow, erratic or even non-functional. For those systems that are capable of generating FooocusPlus images with only 4GB of VRAM, we include a unique default base model that is small and fast. In addition, FooocusPlus supports Stable Diffusion 1.5 (SD1.5), which should run in most 4GB VRAM cards.

FooocusPlus supports NVIDIA graphics cards on Windows and Linux, macOS on Silicon, and many AMD graphics cards on Linux. We also support using AMD graphics cards on Windows at a reduced speed, and provide limited support for macOS on Intel.

**Installing FooocusPlus Preview**

FooocusPlus is currently in preview, which means we are still working on ways to make the installation process even easier. However, you can get a sneak peak of FooocusPlus right now by downloading:

- The _latest_ version of [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org/) (the installation may fail if the version is not current)
- The [FooocusPlus](https://huggingface.co/DavidDragonsage/FooocusPlus/resolve/main/FooocusPlus.zip) Windows program archive
- The FooocusPlus [Model Starter Pack](https://huggingface.co/DavidDragonsage/FooocusPlus/resolve/main/StarterPack.7z) (the Starter Pack is optional but will save you a lot of time later)

After your downloads have completed, first install 7-Zip. Next, install the Windows program archive to create a FooocusPlus folder, and then install the Model Starter Pack to the models folder. Double-click on the run_FooocusPlus.bat file (or the Chinese version, 常规启动.bat) to load FooocusPlus for the first time. We’ll download some additional components automatically on the first run.
